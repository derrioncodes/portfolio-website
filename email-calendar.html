            <h2 style="margin-bottom: 30px;">Overview</h2>
            <p>In this project we are building an email campaign calendar for the month of August. It is for a brand called Wilde, they are healthy snack brand that sells protein chips made from chicken breast, egg whites and bone broth to help with overall health and wellness while eating a delicious snack.</p>
            <p>Their target audience are people who care about eating healthy and want a snack they can enjoy without worrying about macronutrients.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="project-page-content">
            <h2 style="margin-bottom: 30px;">Creating the Email Calendar</h2>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Creating an effective monthly email campaign calendar is like creating a roadmap for success. It ensures our campaigns are timely, relevant, and aligned with our audience's needs and the brand's business goals.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; font-weight: bold;">To start building a campaign calendar, we need to focus on these four key questions:</p>
            <ul style="margin-left: 38px;">
                <li style="list-style: decimal; margin-bottom: 15px;">What holidays or events are happening this month?</li>
                <li style="list-style: decimal; margin-bottom: 15px;">Does the brand want to run any sales or promotions?</li>
                <li style="list-style: decimal; margin-bottom: 15px;">Are there specific products or collections the brand wants to highlight?</li>
                <li style="list-style: decimal; margin-bottom: 20px;">Are there any new releases that need to be covered?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Answering these questions will give us a strong foundation for our monthly calendar. Next, we will think about other value-driven micro-topics that educate and nurture the audience while positioning the brand's products as solutions to their needs. These additional topics will help fill out the rest of the calendar and create a well-rounded campaign plan.</p>
            <p>For an effective campaign calendar, we aim to send 3&#8209;4 emails per week. This ensures the brand remains top of mind with their subscribers without overwhelming them. The focus should be on delivering value-driven content so that our emails build trust and loyalty, rather than relying heavily on discounts that could eat into the brand's profitability. If subscribers feel like we're always trying to take something from them instead of offering value, they may start ignoring your emails altogether.</p>
            <p>By creating a thoughtful, balanced campaign calendar, we can keep the audience engaged, build strong relationships, and drive meaningful results for the brand.</p>

                <p class="ordered-list-numbers"><strong>1. Targeting & Time delay</strong></p>
                <p class="p-after-ol">For targeting we want to make sure existing subscribers don't see this form and people who are about to purchase a product don't see this form because we don't want interrupt their experience and let them checkout.</p>
                <p class="p-after-ol">For this pop up form we want to make sure our pop up shows after a 5 - 7 second delay  or when they scroll 50% of the page. This gives the visitor a chance to look around and not be annoyed as soon as they get on the site. We also want to make sure visitors that have seen the form don't see it again for another 15&nbsp;days.</p>

                <p class="p-after-ol">There are several ways I would test this pop-up as we gather data. I would focus on testing one element at a time:</p>
                <ul style="margin-left: 38px;">
                    <li style="list-style:disc; margin-bottom: 15px;"><strong>Offering a different incentive:</strong> Experimenting with a new offer. Is 15% off compelling enough for our visitors, or could another incentive perform better?</li>
                    <li style="list-style:disc; margin-bottom: 15px;"><strong>Testing the layout:</strong> Placing the copy over a background image instead of keeping the image to the right. Would this be more aesthetically pleasing to our visitors?</li>
                    <li style="list-style:disc;"><strong>Adding body copy:</strong> Including additional text below the headline. Does our audience need more information on why they should sign&nbsp;up?</li>
